# Internship Report: Radar Waveform Learning Engineer for Electromagnetic Listening

## Project Description

This project focused on investigating and proposing hypotheses for pattern detection thresholds in radar systems, specifically for electromagnetic listening applications. The goal was to improve the understanding of radar detection in noisy environments and develop practical tools for signal processing.

**Key Objectives:**

* **Threshold Analysis:** Determine the relationship between classification thresholds and the probability of false alarms (PFA).
* **Pattern Recognition:** Develop a Python-based algorithm for recognizing patterns in real-world radar recordings, even in the presence of noise.

## Technical Approach

* **Statistical Modeling:** Approximated the score's probability density as a Gaussian distribution.
* **Threshold Determination:** Analytically derived a formula for the detection threshold in terms of the PFA.
* **Real-World Data Processing:** Created an algorithm to identify and extract known waveform patterns from noisy recordings.

## Results

* **Threshold-PFA Relationship:**  Established a clear relationship between the classification threshold and the PFA, allowing for more informed selection of thresholds.
* **Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Developed a working algorithm capable of detecting radar waveform patterns in real-world data.

## Skills and Tools

* **Radar Signal Processing:**  Gained experience with radar signal processing concepts and techniques.
* **Statistical Analysis:**  Applied statistical methods for data analysis and modeling.
* **Python Development:**  Enhanced Python programming skills, particularly in scientific computing and signal processing libraries.

## Conclusion

This internship provided valuable insights into radar signal processing and pattern recognition. The project successfully demonstrated the ability to analyze detection thresholds and develop algorithms for real-world data.
