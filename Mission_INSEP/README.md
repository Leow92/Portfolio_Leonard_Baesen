# Enhancing Mental Preparation for Young Rugby Athletes at INSEP


**Project Overview**

This project, conducted during an internship at the Pole Performance at INSEP (National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance), focused on improving the mental preparation of the young French national rugby team. By collaborating closely with psychologists, coaches, and athletes, I contributed to a holistic approach to athlete development.  

This involved:

* **Data-Driven Mental Preparation:** Retrieval and processing of data from dynamic databases to inform mental preparation strategies.  
* **Visualized Insights:** Generation and automation of data visualizations to provide clear and actionable insights for athletes and coaches.  
* **Personalized Reporting:** Development of an algorithm to create weekly individual reports for 24 athletes, tailored to their specific mental preparation needs.  

This project aimed to optimize athletes' training, recovery, and overall performance through data-driven mental preparation techniques.  


**Technology Used**

* **Python:** Used for data retrieval, processing, visualization, and algorithm development.
* **Data Visualization Libraries:** Employed to create meaningful visualizations of athlete data: **Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn**.
* **Database Technologies:** Utilized for data retrieval and manipulation from dynamic databases: **LimeSurvey** and **Google Form**.
* **Custom Algorithm Development:** Designed and implemented an algorithm for generating personalized weekly reports.
* **Flask:** Used Flask webapp to generate HTML files.
* **Collaboration with INSEP Psychologists and Coaches:** Integrated psychological and coaching expertise into the project.
* **Athlete Feedback:** incorporated athlete feedback into the creation of the reports.
